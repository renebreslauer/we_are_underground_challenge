# We Are Underground Coding Challenge

## Responsive Product Grid using HTML & CSS

### Responsive
- Products are arranged in a responsive grid. There are 4 columns with a 16px column gap and a 20px grid gap. There is a media query to reduce the grid to 2 columns for screens less than 980px wide
- All other units of measurement are in Rem for maximum responsiveness

### Hover Effect
- As instructed, each product is a link. To give them a floating effect upon hover over, the entire card translates on the X and Y axis and a box-shadow appears. An elongated transition with cubic-bezier curve was added for smoothness.
- I added 1rem padding to the bottom of the product description, so it looks cleaner on hover. Additionally, I may also add a small amount of padding to the left of the product and the description.
