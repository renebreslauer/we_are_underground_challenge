Using the screenshots above as a guide complete the followingâ€¦

- Using HTML5, markup a section with about seven identical products. You can use Placeholder images from https://via.placeholder.com/300
- Using your choice of CSS (css grid, inline-block, float) create a grid of products with 4 columns when above 980px and 2 columns when below 980px. Each column must have a 16px gap and each row a 20px gap. Be sure to give the entire page padding as well.
- Style the price, title, and description as shown. Products must be links.
- Give each product a hover effect of your choice.

Please time your work, just to give us an example. When complete send us your final HTML document and time.
